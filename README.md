## Spotify Emotion/Sentiment Analysis Project
The goal of my final project was to build an application that generates a 50-song Spotify playlist based on a userâ€™s input sentence. The sentence is first analyzed using a logistic regression model to predict its underlying emotion or sentiment. This predicted label is then used to curate a playlist from a pool of songs that have been pre-classified by one of several models: DistilBERT for emotion detection, and either VADER or a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis.

### Instructions
Instructions to run the model(s) can be found in `main.py`
