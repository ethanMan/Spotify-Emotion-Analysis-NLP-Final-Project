## ðŸ§  How It Works
1. User inputs a sentence.
2. A **Logistic Regression** model predicts the sentenceâ€™s **emotion** or **sentiment**.
3. Based on the prediction, a playlist is curated from pre-classified songs.

**Models Used:**
- **Emotion Detection:** [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased)
- **Sentiment Analysis:** [VADER](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) or **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **Input Analysis:** Logistic Regression
